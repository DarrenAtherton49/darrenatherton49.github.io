When I started to seriously look into what it would take to learn to fly, I came across a very useful post detailing all of the costs involved which you can find [here][other-cost-tracker]. Inspired by that post, I thought I would detail my own costs as I go along to give future readers as much information as possible when considering learning to fly. Furthermore, the costs of flight schools, books and equipment can all differ greatly based on factors such as the location of the school and the condition of the books and equipment, therefore I think it is a good idea to publish accounts from as many people as possible of just how much it can cost to get into flying.
